Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on a #100DaysChallenge where I'll be adding more content each day for 100 days, in the form of additional projects or a blog or documents my learnings. So there's more to look forward to (at least in the till the challenge is done). :)

## Me
Hi, I’m <b>Mowlanica Billa</b>. <i>/(mowla) (nica) (billa)/</i><br>
(Yeah, yeah I know what you are thinking, what kinda name is this, and how do I pronouce it)
I know it's pretty unique :D

Though I hail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam">Visakapatnam</a>, Andhra Pradesh, India, I have been almost all my in <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>, Telangana where I completed my schooling, my Engineering from <a href = "https://www.cbit.ac.in/">Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology (CBIT)</a>, Hyderabad and currently pursuing a <a href = "iiit.ac.in/admissions/postgraduate/pgssp/">PGSS Programme</a>(Part-time Master's) in Computer Science from <a href ="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT-H</a> (one of the most prestigious colleges in India)

I currently live in Hyderabad, working as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://swzd.com/">Spiceworks-ZiffDavis</a>, where I'm currently working on NLP-related projects! We’re an amazing company bringing up new ideas and for improving Marketing(iABM) and Advertising needs. I sometimes do Analysis and research on the old/new versions of our products for further improvements.

In the past, I’ve worked as a Junior Data Scientist at a startup in Hyderabad, Telangana.

So yeah, I have my fair share of startup experience.

I am also into watercolor art, crafts, fashion, exploring and cooking food (yumm....., I can eat biryani and panipuri,all-day, everyday). I switch between the other hobbies as well,seasonally. I am a huge movie buff. Also trying to learn different languages from subtitles while watching movies/TV-series :P 
As the South Korean director <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bong_Joon-ho">Bong Joon Ho</a> once said 
<p style="margin-left: 30%;margin-right: 30%; background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">
<i>“Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” </i>
</p>
So I watch almost all kinds of movies especially the Crime-Thrillers, Investigation, Mystery and Feel-good ones.
